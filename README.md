# Looking for new maintainer
I am graduating at the end of this semester (December 2020 == AY2020/2021 Semester 1 == Fall 2020), and so I will most likely not have time to maintain nor the necessary access to test and dogfood the features.
If you are interested in maintaining the project, do contact me at the email address I use to author the commits on this repository.

If I can't find a new maintainer by the end of 2020, I will archive the project.
Feel free to fork this project, as it was released under the MIT license.

<sup><sub>F LumiNUS! IVLE ftw! Why fix what ain't broken?!</sub></sup>

Since IVLE will be deprecated next academic year (AY2019/2020), while LumiNUS has consistently pushed back its schedule to release an API, I have decided to reverse-engineer the API used by the Angular front-end of LumiNUS. Currently, my goal is to be able to automatically download files a la [ivle-sync](https://github.com/goweiwen/ivle-sync)

I try to keep to best coding practices and use as little dependencies as possible. Do let me know if you have any suggestions!

PR's are welcome.
